This project is a social network that was created in Python 

WE read from nw1_data and nw2_data files and get the information on friend connections

then, based on this friend connection, we will recommend a friend to one of the members that the user selects. 

The system with recommend in this way:
if 0 is friend with 1 and 2, and 1 and 2 aren't friends with each other, the recommended friend for 2 will be 1 and vice versa
